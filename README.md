# sign-language-detection
The Python Sign Language Detection project uses Mediapipe, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pillow, and OS. Employing computer vision, it tracks hand movements, extracts features, and employs a Random Forest classifier for real-time gesture translation to text on the webcam feed, enhancing accessibility.
